            <figcaption>
            <p    >The grading system, despite our best efforts, is a little complex. This occasionally leads to some misunderstandings. These are the most common ones. <br></p><p    >First, <strong>scoring half the available points is not enough to pass</strong>. There is no rule that says that half the points should correspond to a passing grade. In our case, we’ve found that a pass mark somewhere between 50 and 55 point for the quizzes and the exam together, means you’ve leanerd the minimum required subject matter. We will choose the final pass mark after the exam has been graded.<br></p><p    >Second, the fact that you can get between 0 and 10 point for each quiz <strong>does not mean that these represent grades</strong>. That is, if you get 6 points for a quiz, that doesn’t mean you’re on your way to a <em>grade</em> of 6. The points get added to the total, and the total needs to be higher than the pass mark.<br></p><aside    >Getting 6 points for every quiz means that you’ll need to score 26 points on the exam in the best case, and 31 in the worst. The latter is doable, but a relatively high score, so it’s advisable to aim a little higher than this for the quizzes.</aside><aside    ></aside>

It's technically possible that an exam question deals with something that has only been mentioned in the literature, but it's rare.<br></p><p    >The exam has a very predictable structure, which you can use to your advantage. See Practice Exam A on Canvas for details. The main thing to worry about are the active knowledge questions. These require you to do things like calculating something, deriving something, or following an algorithm. In short, this is the stuff you need to practice beforehand. We do so in the homework sessions.<br></p><p    ></p>

One approach is to watch the videos at high speed, and try to understand them just well enough to formulate some questions. Then, attend the QA session, which should allow you to follow most of the discussion. After that, use the written lecture notes to work through the more complex parts slowly. </p><p    ></p>

            <p    >Finally, we’d like to point a few things that often show up in evaluations, and what we do about these points of criticism.<br></p><p    >The first complaint we often hear is that the course is too difficult and requires a lot of math skills. We ask programme directors to check that students have at least <em>some </em>background in probability, calculus and linear algebra before adding this course to their program. Still for some people that means having had calculus in high school, or having to recall a linear algebra courser that wasn’t very successful. We do our best to give you time to brush up on your preliminaries before we get into the hard math. This year, we’ve added a lecture you can check before the course, to ensure that the preliminaries are up to scratch. <br></p><p    >The flipside of this is that we have certain goals to achieve. We don’t just need to convey machine learning, many of you are going to do a master next year (or some the year after) where the mathematical level is much higher. If we hold back now, you will only suffer more next year. In short, there is a limit to how much simpler we can make the course. <br></p><p    >On the other side, we also hear that the course is <em>too simple</em>. More specifically, that despite all the complicated stuff we talk about, you only really need to master a small subset of the material in order to pass. It’s important to realize that this is <em>by design</em>. Doing this is not cheating. We carefully choose a subset of the material as primary learning goals. Knowing these inside and out will get you a passing grade, and the better you know the rest, the closer you get to a 10. This is is how course are supposed to work. Especially a course like this, with so many students.<br></p><p    >Finally, a recurring theme is that the workgroups and project groups don’t add much, or that there is too much variation in quality between the TAs. This is a difficult problem to solve at our current scale, but we are experimenting with various techniques. These include better communication between TAs and more support for TAs in designing their sessions. We can’t promise that this will improve immediately, but we are working on it.<br></p><p    ><br></p><p    ></p>

            <p    >To illustrate the situation, here are the average passing grades and the pass percentages of previous years. Please note that these do not point to a disproportionately difficult course. In fact, some years are a little higher than what would be expected from a sufficiently challenging course.<br></p><aside    >These are the percentages of active students that passed, and the average grades among that percentage of students who passed<br></aside><p    >This doesn’t mean we don’t sympathise if you find the course difficult, or that we think it’s your own fault. We are always happy to help, and we strongly believe everybody should be able to learn these concepts. It’s just that these numbers don’t indicate that there is a serious problem, or that an overhaul is called for.<br></p><aside    >Nevertheless, this year we have decided to remove some of the more technical subjects which have become less relevant in the last few years: support vector machines, and with them Lagrange multipliers. We’ve decided not to replace these by other subjects, but instead to give the remainder a little more room to breathe. This will hopefully lighten the load a little.<br></aside><p    ><br></p><p    ><br></p><aside    ></aside>

            <p    >This doesn't mean you should just give up if you find yourself overwhelmed by the material. It's perfectly possible and acceptable to pass the course without understanding all the ins and outs of every topic discussed. <br></p><p    >Quite often, the slides aim to provide a <em>complete</em> story so that if you need to know all the details about a certain topic, you have them in a self-contained package. That doesn't mean, however, that you always need to understand all details of every subject. You can often skip the technical details, so long as you understand the larger message. You don't always need to know how to get from A to B, so long as you understand what A and B are, and why it's important to get from one to the other.<br></p><p    >To help you separate the wheat from the chaff, please look at the <strong>practice exams </strong>early on. They will help you to understand what it is you should focus on, if you find that the whole of a lecture is too much to digest. In general it's fine to skip the occasional technical detail, but there are a few subjects that you need to master properly for the exam.<br></p><p    >When it comes to following complex mathematical derivations, please note that it gets easier with practice. Maybe it takes you an hour to follow all the steps in a single slide the first time around, and your heart sinks at the prospect of doing that several times for every lecture. Please note that if you persevere, it will get easier very quickly, and before long, it will be second nature.<br></p><p    >The practice of recording videos may give the unfortunate impression that all material can be absorbed by passively watching a video. You should expect to get as much out of watching the videos passively as you get out of attending a live lecture. It should be enough to set the stage, and to give a skeletal understanding of the subject, but to get the details, an active approach is necessary: you need to watch with pen and paper ready, and you'll have to frequently pause. Hopefully, the lecture notes can help with this part of the process.</p><p    ></p>

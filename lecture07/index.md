            <p    >This is the first of several lectures that deal with deep learning. Deep learning evolved out of neural networks, but it’s slightly more than just the business of training very large and very deep neural nets. We’ll discuss exactly what makes a deep learning model at the end of the lecture. <br></p><p    ><br></p><p    ></p>

            <p    >For now, we’ll pick up the discussion about neural networks from the last lecture, and develop the idea further.<br></p><p    >Here’s how we defined a neural network last time around. A neural network is a model described by a graph: each node represents a scalar value. The value of each node is computed from the incoming edges by multiplying the weight on the edge by the value of the node it connects to.<br></p><p    >We train the model by tuning the weights. Every <span class="orange">orange</span> and <span class="blue">blue</span> line in this picture represents one of those weights. The feedforward network, seen here,  is the simplest way of wiring up a neural net, but we will see other possibilities later.<br></p><p    ></p>

            <p    >In addition to the graph perspective, there’s another perspective that can greatly simplify things. Most of the operations used in neural networks can also be written as matrix multiplications. <br></p><p    >Consider what happens in the first layer before the non-linearity, ignoring the bias nodes. If we see the input nodes and the hidden nodes as two vectors (of 2 and 3 elements respectively), then each element in the hidden vector is computed by multiplying all elements of the input vector by a unique weight, and summing them together. This is exactly the operation of a matrix multiplication.<br></p><p    >Adding the bias can be cast as a simple vector addition, and applying the nonlinearity is simply and element-wise non-linear operation on the vector.<br></p><p    >In this way, we can express the whole operation of a neural network in terms of simple linear algebra operations.</p><p    ></p>

            <p    >In <span class="red">this video</span>, we’ll look at the general layout of deep learning frameworks. Specifcally, how these systems allow us to define complex models in such a way that they can be efficiently computed and that we don’t have to implement backpropagation ourselves. A large part of this, is expressing everything we do in the language of <em>tensors</em>.<br></p><p    >In the <span class="red">second video</span>, we’ll look specifically at how we can implement backpropagation in such tensor settings. We’ve seen a scalar version of the algorithm already, where we work out the derivatives of the parameters one by one, but when we want to implement this efficiently, using tensor operations, we need to take a few more things into account.<br></p><p    >Deep learning works best when we don’t use fully connected layers, but when we tailor the architecture of our network to our task. In the <span class="red">third video</span>, we’ll look at the first type of layer that allows us to do this: the convolution. This layer is particularly suited to image data.<br></p><p    >And finally, to do deep learning efficiently, we need to know a number of tricks and tools. We’ll run through the most important ones briefly in the <span class="red">last video</span>.<br></p><p    >We don’t have time in this lecture to go into all the details. If you are doing your project on a deep learning topic, and you need to know more, you can have a look at the materials for <a href="http://dlvu.github.io"><strong class="blue">our Deep Learning course in the master</strong></a>. They discuss the same subjects, but in more detail, with more examples (in particular lectures 2, 3, and 4).</p><p    ></p>

            <p    >These are our aims for the first two videos. In order to scale up the basic principle of backpropagation on neural networks, we want to move from operations on scalars (that is on individual numbers) to the linear algebra view: everything is a vector, a matrix or a higher dimensional analog of that and all operations (including this in the backpropagation step) are operations on such objects.<br></p><p    >These vectors, matrices and higher dimensional analogs are called<strong> tensors</strong>. Let's start by looking at what tensors are, and how we can define functions on them.</p><p    ></p>

            <figcaption>
            <p    >For our purposes, a <strong>tensor</strong> is nothing more than a straightforward generalisation of vectors and matrices to higher dimensionalities. A tensor is collection of numbers arranged in a grid. The<strong> rank </strong>of the tensor, is the number of dimensions along which the values change. <br></p><p    >A vector is a rank 1 tensor: a one-dimensional array. Its shape can be described by one integer: how many numbers there are arranged along one dimension.<br></p><p    >A matrix is a rank 2 tensor: a two dimensional array. Its shape is described by two integers: how many rows it has and how many columns.<br></p><p    >Following this logic, we can also think of a a single number (a scalar) as a rank 0 tensor.<br></p><p    >Extending this idea, we can create tensors of rank 3, 4 and higher. Above rank three, they’re not easy to visualize, but you can think of a rank 4 tensor as a collection of rank-3 tensors, arranged along an extra dimension (just like a matrix is a collection of vectors arranged along an extra dimension).<br></p><p    >If you’ve done the first worksheet, you’ll already know the tensor as the basic data structure of numpy. There it is more often called a <strong>multidimensional array</strong>.<br></p><p    >The idea of deep learning frameworks is that we can deal with any data, so long as it’s represented as one or more tensors. Let’s look at some examples of how data is represented in tensor form.</p><p    ></p>

            <p    >But the real benefit in deep learning is not just in representing our standard abstract tasks as features matrices. We want to find ways to represent the <strong>raw data</strong>, or at least something closer to the raw data, as tensors.<br></p><p    >One example is image data. A single image can be represented a a 3-tensor. In an RGB image, the color of a single pixel is represented using three values between 0 and 1 (how <span>red</span> it is, how <span>green</span> it is and how <span>blue</span> it is). This means that an RGB image can be thought of as a stack of three matrices, each representing one of the color channels as a grayscale image. This stack is a 3-tensor.<br></p><aside    ><br></aside><aside    >source: <a href="http://www.adsell.com/scanning101.html"><strong class="blue">http://www.adsell.com/scanning101.html</strong></a></aside><aside    ><a href="http://www.adsell.com/scanning101.html"><strong class="blue"></strong></a></aside>

            <p    >In the previous lecture, we introduced the concept of a <strong>computation graph</strong>. This is a graph that details the computation of our model and its loss. It consists of circular nodes that represent the inputs, intermediate nodes, and outputs of a computation, and of diamond nodes that represent the different computations we apply to these values. <br></p><p    >If a proper computation graph value nodes only connect to computation nodes and vice versa (they are bipartite graph). However, in the interest of clarity, we will sometimes omit the computation nodes and use the shorthand on the right.<br></p><p    >In the previous lecture, the computation graph was something we only drew on pen and paper to help us figure out what the correct backpropagation rules were for a given model. In this lecture, <strong>we are going to actually represent the computation graph in the computer</strong>, and let the computer figure out the backpropagation algorithm for us, based on the computations that we choose to do.</p><p    ></p>

            <figcaption>
            <p    >To build our computation graph, and to do it with tensors, we’ll need <strong>functions</strong> that consume tensors, and spit our new tensors. A function can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs, and all of them are tensors. Non-tensor inputs are sometimes allowed, but when we start computing gradients, we’ll only get gradients over the tensor inputs.<br></p><p    >Functions exist in many programming environments. All we usually have to do to specify a function is to define how to compute the output given the inputs. In deep learning parlance this is called the <strong>forward</strong> of the function. For a deep learning function, we need to specify one additional thing: a <strong>backward</strong> function. The backward receives the gradients for the<span class="orange"> outputs </span>and computes the gradients for the<span class="blue"> inputs.</span> We’ll see some examples of this in the second video.<br></p><p    >Putting  these two ingredients, tensors and functions, together,  we can build a model. We define some functions and we then chain them together into a <strong>computation graph</strong>.</p><p    ></p>

            <figcaption>
            <p    >There are two ways of doing this.

            <p    ><strong>Eager execution</strong> does not require this kind to predefining of the computation graph. You simply use programming statements to compute the forward pass, for instance multiplying two matrices. The deep learning system then ensures that your matrices are special objects, that keep track of the whole computation, so that when it comes time to do the backpropagation pass, we know how to go back through the computation we performed.<br></p><p    >Since eager execution seems to be fast becoming the default approach, we will focus on that, and describe in detail how an eager execution deep learning system works.</p><p    ></p>

            <p    >There are ways to define the derivative of a function with respect to a matrix or a vector. In general, if we have a function with a tensor input and a tensor output, we can take a large number of scalar derivatives by taking the derivative of one of its outputs with respect to one of its inputs. The gradient is an example of this: we have a function from a vector to a scalar, so we take all scalar derivatives of the output with respect to one of the inputs, and collect them into a vector. <br></p><p    >If we have a function from a vector to a scalar, we can collect all derivatives of one output with repsect to the single input. This can also be neatly represented in a vector.<br></p><p    >If we have a vector-to-vector function, we can take all scalar derivatives of one of the m outputs with respect to one of the n inputs. This is best represented by a n-by-m <em>matrix</em>.<br></p><p    >If we go higher, like a matrix-to-vector function, we get so many derivatives that we need a 3-tensor to represent them. And this is where we run into trouble. <br></p><p    >For matrices and vectors, multiplication is still defined, and works similarly to scalar multiplication. That means that so long as our derivatives are only matrices and vectors, we can still hope for a functional chain rule, where we can work out the local derivatives compute them and multiply them together. But this already breaks down in the case of the feedforward network. If we imagine what a chain of local derivatives for our computation graph might look like, we’d get something like this expression at the bottom. even for something so simple as a feedforward network, one of the factors is already the derivative of a vector over a matrix. This means the result should be represented in a 3-tensor, for which multiplication isn’t defined (or at least not unambiguously), so that we can never multiply all the local derivatives to give us the global derivatives.<br></p><p    ></p>

In our case, we are not interested in using the gradient in this way: it only ever defines a direction in our model space, which will help us search, so for us it makes more sense to have the gradient be the same shape and size as the points in the model space.</aside><aside    ></aside>

It just removes some of the information coming in based on what the layers below it have done. We need to backpropagate through it to train the layers below, but it doesn't have any trainable properties of its own.</p><p    ></p>

            <p    >So what can these convolutional operations learn? How do they transform the image, for different values of the weights? To investigate we can look at the transformation from one input channel to one output channel (from one grayscale image to another).<br></p><p    >Here is an example: the Gaussian convolution. It takes a pixel neighbourhood and averages the pixels in it, creating a blurred result of the input. This is just one transformation that a convolution filter can perform, depending on the weights, many other operations are possible. We get this transformation in a 3x3 kernel where the middle weight is the largest and the surrounding weights are small positive values. The convolution then outputs essentially the input image, but each pixel is mixed with a little of its surrounding pixels' values.<br></p><p    >While Gaussian blur may seem to be throwing away valuable information, what we actually get is a representation that is <strong>invariant to noise</strong>. All these noisy input images in the left will be mapped to the same image on the right. We can do the same thing to create representations invariant to, for instance, small translations.</p><p    ></p>

Different weights perform very different functions, so ideally we want to look at the properties of the loss landscape for each weight (the sizes of recent gradients) and scale the “global learning rate” by these. In some ways, this is what the momentum vector is doing for us: is gives every weight a separate momentum scalar that changes how much that weight will changes separate from all the other weights.<br></p><p    >Adam is a method that takes this idea and adds another per-weight tuning on top of this: a scaling by the standard deviation of recent gradient values.<br></p><p    >The bigger the recent gradients, the bigger we want the learning rate to be (this is what momentum does for us). However, if there is a lot of variance in the recent gradients, we want to reduce the learning rate because the landscape is unpredictable. Thus, if we scale the learning rate by the mean <strong class="blue">m</strong> over the recent gradients (similar to momentum), and divide that by the square root of the variance <strong class="blue">v</strong> (plus some small epsilon to avoid division by zero), we end up with a direction that uses recent information about the loss landscape to adapt the gradient.<br></p><p    ><strong class="blue">m</strong> and <strong>v</strong> are computed as an exponential moving average. This means that the current gradient weights the most, and the influence of recent gradients decays exponentially (but all play <em>some </em>part in the total sum).<br></p><aside    >It may not be immediately obvious that the <strong class="blue">m</strong> vector is doing roughly the same thing here as the momentum <strong class="blue">m</strong> is, but with a little rewriting, you can show that they are very similar.
